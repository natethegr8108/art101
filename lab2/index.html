            <h1>Hello world</h1>

            <p>We are Leon and Nate. We met through the school's Overwatch team. 
                Leon is a 3rd year AGPM Major and Nate is a 4th year Computer Engineering major.
                Leon has much more programming experience than Nate. We are both fans of Uni the cat.
